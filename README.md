# Tetra-token
an open protocol that facilitates the decentralized exchange of Ethereum-based tokens and assets. Developers can use 0x to build their own custom exchange apps with a wide variety of user-facing applications i.e. Tetra OTC, a decentralized application that facilitates trustless over-the-counter trading of Ethereum-based tokens.  The Tetra token (ZRX) is used by Makers and Takers to pay transaction fees to Relayers (entities that host and maintain public order books). Tetra tokens are also used for decentralized governance over 0x protocolâ€™s update mechanism which allows its underlying smart contracts to be replaced and improved over time.
